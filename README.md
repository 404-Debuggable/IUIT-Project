# IUIT-Project
## Abstract
In our current educational system, students are subjected to a series of repetitive 
assessments each academic year, designed to measure their comprehension and 
mastery of various subjects. This traditional approach not only models a 
one-size-fits-all method of evaluation but also leads to a considerable backlog in 
grading, which drains both educators' time and resources. In many cases, 
teachers find themselves spending hours grading papers when that time could be 
better used for instructional planning or direct student engagement. 

To tackle these inefficiencies, we propose the creation of an innovative online 
testing platform that allows students to complete their exams securely and 
conveniently directly on the website. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, 
this platform would feature instant grading capabilities for both subjective and 
objective questions. The project would involve inputting detailed syllabi and 
curricular standards into the AI system, giving it the necessary context to 
accurately assess student submissions.
